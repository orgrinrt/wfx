# Module API

The api exposed to modules

1. remains as stable as is sensible across versions
2. only allow breaking changes on major version bumps

These files document the initial intention and requirements for the apis, the actual documentation on implementations and specifics can be found on the appropriate rustdocs of the respective crates (to be hyperlinked here though)
